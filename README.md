# Generic Standard Template Library (STL)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Generic Standard Template Library (STL)** project is implemented in **C++** and provides **generic implementations of various data structures and algorithms**. By leveraging the power of templates and generics, this project allows the usage of data structures and operations for **any data type** based on specific requirements.

This repository is useful for developers, students, and programmers who want to understand **generic programming** and **STL concepts** in C++.
